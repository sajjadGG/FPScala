This repo is used as a guide in the jourany of Functional Programming using Scala
and will contains important inforamtion and tips and hints revolving this subject

## Functional Programming Concepts

### Higher-order function
since functions are values they can be passed into another functions. 


## AHAs
- There are no operators in scala simply calling the method without infix 
`2+1` is `2.+(1)` since + is the name of a method in object 2 and any method with single
argument can be called this way : `MyModule.abs(42)` is the same as `MyModule abs 42`


## Hints

### Using scala REPL
you can run it by typing `scala` and to load some code into it use `:load MyModule.scala`
